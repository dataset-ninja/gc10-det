**GC10-DET** (GC10-DET: Metallic surface defect detection) is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the manufacturing industry.

The dataset consists of 2300 images with 3563 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *silk_spot*, *welding_line*, *punching_hole*, and other: *water_spot*, *crescent_gap*, *oil_spot*, *inclusion*, *waist folding*, *crease*, and *rolled_pit*.

Each image in the GC10-DET dataset has bounding boxes annotations. There are 8 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (2300 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [The State Key Lab of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/dpien/info/1092/1039.htm#:~:text=03%20Views%3A%20954-,The%20State%20Key%20Laboratory%20of%20Precision%20Measurement%20Technology%20and%20Instruments,to%20the%20public%20in%201995.).
