**GC10-DET: Metallic Surface Defect Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the industrial domain and defect detection research. 

The dataset consists of 2300 images with 3563 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *silk_spot*, *welding_line*, *punching_hole*, and other: *water_spot*, *crescent_gap*, *oil_spot*, *inclusion*, *waist folding*, *crease*, and *rolled_pit*.

Images in the GC10-DET dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 8 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the [The State Key Lab of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Tianjin University, China](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/dpien/info/1092/1039.htm#:~:text=03%20Views%3A%20954-,The%20State%20Key%20Laboratory%20of%20Precision%20Measurement%20Technology%20and%20Instruments,to%20the%20public%20in%201995.).
